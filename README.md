# StarFox-AI
A project focused on computer vision and spatial awareness in AI. Operates on higan using a virtual controller, right now still in the stage of intial development, including the algorithms for simple training.

Here, FoxAI plays a game of the "Training" game mode, right now it is currently in it's infant stage, like GuineaBot3 it did start very small, (which still has bugs by the way, thus we haven't seen it for a long time, help [here.](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/deep-GuineaBot3-lichess-bot))
## Currently in development, come back later! (unless you're willing to help) ##

We need help with this project, please [fork](../../fork) this repository and implement some cool features and open a pull request! (i.e., a complete integration into higan's emulator or something.) Or if you want to be more directly involved, you can join [here.](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/join)

We are also in need of players on higan playing this game, so we can train Peppy on the gameplay to evaluate FoxAI in real time. Please use the "higan.py" file to continously take screenshots of higan (note: This data will not be labeled, it will be labeled by our [Dataset Labeling](https://github.com/orgs/GuineaBot3Labs/teams/dataset-labelers) team.
