![FoxAI in training game mode](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/StarFox-AI/blob/main/FoxAI.png)

Here, FoxAI plays a game of the "Training" game mode, right now it is currently in it's infant stage, like GuineaBot3 it did start very small, (which still has bugs by the way, thus we haven't seen it for a long time, help [here.](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/deep-GuineaBot3-lichess-bot))
## Currently in development, come back later! (unless you're willing to help) ##

We need help with this project, please [fork](../../fork) this repository and implement some cool features and open a pull request! (i.e., a complete integration into higan's emulator or something.) Or if you want to be more directly involved, you can join [here.](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/join)
