# StarFox-AI
A project focused on computer vision and spatial awareness in AI. Operates on higan using a virtual controller, right now still in the stage of intial development, including the algorithms for simple training. (Works only in linux right now)

![FoxAI in training game mode](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/StarFox-AI/blob/main/FoxAI.png)

Here, FoxAI plays a game of the "Training" game mode, right now it is currently in it's infant stage, like GuineaBot3 it did start very small, (which still has bugs by the way, thus we haven't seen it for a long time, help [here.](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/GuineaBot3))

# Update!

This repository will probably use a [modified version of ares](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/ares-env) to interface with, until then however, this project is post-poned.

## Setup (Documentation incomplete!) ##

This project has been postponed for now. Until then, you can help on [ares-env](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/ares-env)

where you will insert the lines for ubuntu's repo, and if the key is missing then add it, finally, run:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install higan

You will have to **LEGALLY** obtain a StarFox ROM. Load this ROM into the emulator, and do the rest. (May require fiddling around with the settings.)

Download the requirements like so:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Currently in development, come back later! (unless you're willing to help) ##

If you want to help develop this project, please help on the [ares-env](https://github.com/GuineaBot3Labs/ares-env) project.
